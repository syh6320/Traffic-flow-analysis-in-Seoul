This project uses taxi driving records to analyse, predict traffic situation.

1. demostration_analysis: predict if there will be some big event, like demonstration, in certain area.

2. heatmap for grid: created grid system on whole city, analysing traffic situation(speed, passenger rate of taxi) in different time period by heat map.

3. heat for link: created trajectory for taxi, analysing traffic situation(speed, passenger rate of taxi) in different time period by heat map.

4. reachability analyse: For example, there are 23 fire stations in city, we find convex hull area covered by each station in some time(like 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc)
                         In this way, we can find if there exist some hole area in city so that we can improve public service.
